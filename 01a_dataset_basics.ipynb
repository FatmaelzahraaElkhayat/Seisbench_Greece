        "The last configuration option discussed in this tutorial is waveform caching. As mentioned earlier, loading a dataset actually only loads the metadata into memory, and only reads the waveforms on demand. Depending on your use case, this might not be the optimal scenario. For example, when training a deep learning model, it's usually best to first load all the waveforms into memory, instead of reloading them from disk every epoch. Therefore, SeisBench allows to cache waveforms in memory and to preload them into memory. Here is an example:"

As a rule of thumb, `trace` should be used if you only need a small fraction of the dataset, while `full` is better suited when using most of the dataset or a full train/dev/test split.
